## WE Build Value
WE believe in the efficiency of small teams and pair programming.
WE ensure that our projects are manageable, measurable and our clients have a clear understanding of what they are getting.
We are not interested in making large projects so that we can bill out inefficient coders – our experience has been that large projects mean large inefficient teams, cost overruns, missed deliverables, poor client communication, specification misunderstanding and unhappy customers.

We've worked with large enterprises all our lives, and we know the strengths and weaknesses of those environments.
We are flexible about how we can work with you, but we prefer to provide you with a complete solution, and operate it for you.
This saves you the risk and hassle of a large up-front expense, while ensuring that our interests are aligned with yours.

## Who Are WE?
WE are Larry Reid and Phil Carrillo.
Together we have over 70 years of experience in successfully delivering IT solutions to major clients such as Canada Post, Elections Canada, General Motors, BMW, Dupont, SAAB, AECL, John Deere, HealthSouth, SourceMedical, Teck Resources, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Australian Centre for Remote Sensing, Vancouver Coastal Health, ICBC, TELUS, and BC Hydro.  

WE enjoy meeting and understanding our clients – we pay attention to their business requirements and don’t try to overwhelm them with computer “bafflespeak”.

WE believe in quality, our work is tested and reliable.  WE don’t take short cuts.
As Mr Reid puts it “if you don’t have time to do it right, then you certainly don’t have time to do it wrong”.

WE believe in meeting our commitments.

      Web applications

      The Web made the power of computers available to people
      like nothing before.
      And then the mobile Web, on our phones and tablets,
      made it all available to us everywhere.
      Anyone with a smart phone can find pretty much any information
      at any time, via Google searches, Wikipedia,
      or many other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only can we find information,
      we can learn,
      watch movies,
      play games,
      pay bills,
      do our banking,
      and any number of other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most business are still struggling to reach that level of sharing,
      learning,
      and doing inside the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many good reasons for this,
      but basically,
      it's darn expensive and risky to develop software.
      Fortunately, a number of the technical reasons for
      the cost and risk
      have disappeared in the last five to ten years.
      Modern Web development frameworks,
      open source software,
      and cloud based platforms,
      among other things,
      have made it much easier,
      faster,
      cheaper,
      and therefore less risky,
      to develop Web applications.
      Applications that bring the power of the Web
      to the internal or external operations
      of medium and even small-sized businesses.

      They also empower small teams to deliver quality,
      usable software.
      Small teams are more productive than big teams,
      because less time is wasted communicating
      between team members.
      And small teams are less risky than big teams,
      because the broken telephone effect is less of a problem.

      Web apps are particularly suited to database applications.  In these applications all users have access to the latest
      dataset and problems associated with data synchronization can be greatly simplified.

      We Can Help You Get Your application On Line Quickly and Efficiently
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our experience has taught us that each Web application project presents
      unique challenges.  Some apps have well defined functionality, while others may
      need more function development.  Some apps require working closely with users
      to develop a good human interface.  Some projects are looking for extra resources
      to work on an particular feature or enhancement, others prefer to outsource the
      entire development and operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first priority becomes understanding your challenge and proposing a way of working
      together to meet your objectives.  We like to break down our projects into
      managable pieces so that you can easily monitor the progress without feeling
      that you have been stuck in a morass of the big software project.  In cases where
      functionality is not well defined, we recommend starting with smaller, proof of
      concept projects, so that functions are well defined before committing to the
      higher costs of production releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use modern web development frameworks and languages, to give you applications
      that work the way your users expect them to. We automate the testing of the
      application (“test driven development”), so it’s easy to enhance the application,
      or fix bugs, with the confidence that the application still does everything it did
      before. We use continuous integration and continuous delivery, so you can see the
      progress we’re making, and so we’re ready to deploy enhancements as soon as you’re ready for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can take advantage of availability of cloud resources to house your application.  These
      resources are scaled to meet your requirements so that you can deploy your application
      efficiently, reliably, quickly, and at a resonable cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can operate your application for you, or we can interface with your internal resouces
      so that you can run the application yourself.  When we are responsible for application operations,
      we deploy your application rapidly and easily through automated processes.  We monitor your
      application continuously and respond to problems, often before you even notice them. By
      leveraging computers to help us do our job, you get a stable, reliable application that's easy to enhance and fix.
